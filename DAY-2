Today is the second day of studying Python and I learnt some new knowledge which made me interested in studying this machine language.

What is coding? Coding is an action through which people can let machines do things. This is because code is the bridge between humanbeings and machines.

There are thousands of machines languages and can be divided into three sorts: 
1.  0/1 this is the oldest machine language.
2.  assembly language which is also aimed to hardware and same as the first one.
3.  primiere language, such as JAVA, PHP, PYTHON, RUBY, etc. And these machine languages are more close to nature language and can be also divided into 2 cataglogues,
    The first sort is called Compiler, such as C, C++, Delphi, etc. 
         Its advantages include that they are fast and do not rely on SC(source code);
         Its disadvantages include that they are not compatible and difficult to modify.
    the second one is called interpreter.
         Its advantages are that they are compatible and easy to modify.
         However, they are not as fast as Compiler languages and must rely on compiler.

Nothing to change, Just add a brief discription of this essay.
Keep in!
